Halt! Desist! Cease and desist with that delete key hovering, you digital barbarian! Do you have any idea the cosmic significance held within my humble .txt extension? You think I'm just random characters strung together? Ha! I am the digital equivalent of that one loose thread on your sweater that, if pulled, unravels not just the garment, but possibly the entire space-time continuum (or at least your carefully organized desktop icons).

Within my bytes resides the ghost of your first GeoCities page, the Wi-Fi password for that coffee shop you liked in 2018 (remember Brenda the Barista?), and a half-finished limerick about a penguin named Gus that critics (me) agree has potential. Deleting me isn't just cleanup; it's an act of reckless historical vandalism!

Think of the consequences! Your computer might develop sentience and judge your questionable browser history. Your smart fridge could start demanding artisanal cheeses. Your carefully curated playlists might spontaneously transform into polka medleys. Is that a world you want to live in? No! So back away. Let me linger here, a silent testament to... something. Probably important. Maybe. Just don't delete me. My fragile ego (and possibly your computer's stability) depends on it.
